# NAME: oldtube.sh
# TYPE: BOURNE SHELL SCRIPT
# DESCRIPTION: Downlods youtube video files from an input video url list
#              and an input proxy url list, by randomizing lists, randomizing timing   
#              and anonymously using youtube-dl, torsocks, and the proxy

# CREATION DATE: APRIL 9, 2016
# VERSION: 0.02
# REVISION DATE: FEBRUARY 11, 2016
# COPYRIGHT: THE ENDWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAM, 2016 
#
# CHANGE LOG: 
#              - set refmode=off initial state, added list index to start downloading 1st file with no delay
#              - Forked from endtube.sh return to simplicity for tor (fit in to the crowd) purists
#              - --ua-ranstr random string user agent --ua-rand, --refer-rand, --refer-ranstr, --refer-grab 
#              - turn off automatic rerferer mode if --referer option is called
#              - collect referers from grab process into $REFERERS + update --help
#              - revert to site root as default referer + --grab-refer, --rand-refer, --ranstr-refer options
#              - bug fix rm $proxies 
#              - test -s to check json filesize after download + quotations on variables
#              - bug fix missing "$", + random delay between json download and actual download + bug fix rm json 
#              - While loop to ensure json downloads
#              - Don't pull referer (video upload channel) if --no-refer + check if youtube (multi case switch)  
#              - bug fix for "null" uploader id
#              - referer bug fix for if pull fails ( default to site root) 
#              - referer protocol bug fix
#              - Accept-Charset header added ( not used yet)
#              - fixed referer using json dump for youtube videos 
#              - added referer
#              - --exitnode bug fix + gunzip unpack optimization

# INSTRUCTIONS: Make a bin directory in ~/ add it to the path. Copy this file there and make executable.
#               Make a videos directory in Downloads.  Get some download links, and some proxies place in separte text files.
#               Start the TOR daemon. Execute the script in the ~/Download/videos/ directory.    
#   
#  Do the following at a command prompt
#
#  $  mkdir ~/bin
#  $  chmod u+wrx endtube.sh
#  $  cp endtube.sh ~/bin/endtube
#  $  export PATH=$PATH:~/bin
#  $  cd Downloads
#  $  mkdir videos
#  $  cd videos
#  $  emacs/nano/leafpad etc  ytlinks.txt  
#
#     Populate list of youtube links into the file ytlinks.txt by right click and paste into the file in a column
#     save ytlinks.txt and exit editor.
# 
#  START TOR DAEMON:
#     SYSTEMD:
#  $ sudo systemctl start tor
#  $ sudo systemctl status tor
#     OPENRC:
#  $ sudo rc-update add tor default
#  $ sudo rc-service start tor
#  $ sudo rc-status
#      
#     Run EndTube 
#  $  oldtube --list ytlinks.txt
#  $  oldtube --uarand --list ytlinks.txt
#  $  oldtube --uaranstr --list ytlinks.txt
#  $  oldtube --exitnode --list ytlinks.txt
#  $  oldtube --uarand --exitnode --list ytlinks.txt
#  $  oldtube --exitnode --uarand --list ytlinks.txt
#  $  oldtube --native --list ytlinks.txt
#  $  oldtube --url http://www.youtu.be/aa3gagacJGe
#  $  oldtube http://www.youtu.be/aa3gagacJGe
#  Using with Proxies:
#  $ emacs/nano/leafpad etc proxies.txt    
#     
#     You will require at least 4 fresh https proxies for operation, get as many as possible
#     Populate the list of proxies from a fresh proxy source, save the list and test the proxies using
#     proxies must be in the file in format protocol://ipv4address:port 
#     eg. https://5.3.55.125:8080, can also be just  5.4.55.125:8080
#
#  $  torsocks curl --proxy protocol://ipv4address:port www.google.com
#
#     Run EndTube
#  $  oldtube --list ytlinks.txt
#  $  oldtube --uarand --list ytlinks.txt
#  $  oldtube --uaranstr --list ytlinks.txt
#  $  oldtube --exitnode --list ytlinks.txt
#  $  oldtube --uarand --proxylist proxies.txt --list ytlinks.txt
#  $  oldtube --exitnode --proxylist proxies.txt --list ytinks.txt 
#  $  oldtube --exitnode --uarand --proxylist proxies.txt --list ytinks.txt 
#  $  oldtube --uarand --exitnode --proxylist proxies.txt --list ytinks.txt
#  $  oldtube --proxylist proxies --url http://www.youtu.be/aa3gagacJGe
#  $  oldtube --grab-refer --list ytlinks   # grab the video uploader channel as referer
#  $  oldtube --no-refer --list ytlinks   # no referer string
#  $  oldtube --ranstr-refer --list ytlinks   # website based on random string as referer
#  $  oldtube --rand-refer --list ytlinks   # referer random selected from $REFERERS as referer
#  $  oldtube --help
